# Project 2 - Group plan

In your first meeting, discuss and record a quick note of your agreed answers to the following questions:

- When and how often will you meet as a group? Will you use Zoom, Teams, something else?



- How will you communicate outside of your meetings (email, Teams, Discord, group chat...)?



- Is everyone comfortable with using git/GitHub? If not, one person could demonstrate for the group during your first meeting; if nobody is comfortable, ask on Piazza or email Charlotte!



- Discuss your ideas for questions to investigate. Are there questions in the suggestions which you find interesting? Do you have new ideas of your own? You can keep a note of these ideas here.



- How do you want to divide the tasks? Are you planning to pair-program?



- Who will put together, proofread, and push the final notebook before the deadline? Will one person be responsible, will you have a final meeting together, or something else?
